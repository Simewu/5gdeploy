# oai

Package **oai** generates OpenAirInterface and CN5G configurations.

OpenAirInterface RAN requires libconfig format files.
The `convert.py` script is used for converting between libconfig and tagged JSON.
It requires an additional package dependency:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-libconf
```
